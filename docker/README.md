# Docker Infrastructure

This directory contains Docker- and Compose-related resources for running the **Home IoT Telemetry** stack.

It will eventually include:

- `docker-compose.yml` for services such as:
  - MQTT broker  
  - InfluxDB  
  - Grafana  
  - Telegraf (optional)  
  - Additional telemetry services
- Environment configuration files
- Deployment and development instructions

This directory serves as the foundation for the project's Infrastructure-as-Code approach.
