# Home Assistant Configuration

This directory contains Home Assistant configuration files used by the **Home IoT Telemetry** project.

It will eventually include:

- Energy and temperature sensor definitions  
- MQTT integrations  
- Template sensors (e.g., domestic hot water and central heating energy calculations)  
- Automations  
- Dashboards  

At this stage, this directory serves as a structural placeholder for future configuration.
